# Exploring Memory Allocation Strategies in the Linux Kernel: A Case Study of SLUB vs SLOB

This repository presents a comprehensive exploration of memory allocation strategies within the Linux Kernel, focusing on a comparative analysis between SLUB and SLOB. The research, conducted by a single individual, includes the implementation of custom operating system code tailored specifically for this study.

Key Objectives:
- Delve into the design principles underlying SLUB and SLOB
- Assess the memory management overhead associated with each strategy
- Measure the performance metrics of allocation and deallocation operations
- Investigate the implications on system stability and resource utilization

Through this solitary research endeavor, the repository aims to provide valuable insights into memory allocation mechanisms in the Linux Kernel and contribute to the ongoing discourse on optimizing memory management for diverse operating system environments.
